## Introduction
Decoded, Your Personality is my final project for the CS50 Harvard course, created by Olivier Paspuel. This project aims to provide users with insights into their personality based on various questions that contain 3D models, making the experience interactive and entertaining. The project also provides explanations about cognitive functions. The algorithm for determining the specific MBTI is written in the file determineMbti.js, which uses family types, middle zones, and a cognitive functions array.

Here are the blocks of text you can add to your README.md to explain the MBTI and cognitive functions theory:

### MBTI Theory
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a widely used personality assessment that categorizes individuals into 16 different personality types. These types are based on four dichotomies:

1. **Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I):** Determines how individuals interact with the world. Extraverts are outward-focused and gain energy from interacting with others, while introverts are inward-focused and recharge by spending time alone.

2. **Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N):** Describes how individuals process information. Sensors rely on their five senses and are detail-oriented, while Intuitives focus on patterns and possibilities.

3. **Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F):** Reflects how individuals make decisions. Thinkers prioritize logic and objectivity, while Feelers prioritize empathy and values.

4. **Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P):** Determines how individuals approach the outside world. Judgers prefer structure and organization, while Perceivers prefer flexibility and spontaneity.

Each of the 16 MBTI types is a unique combination of these four dichotomies, providing a framework for understanding personality differences.

### Cognitive Functions Theory
Cognitive functions are the mental processes through which individuals perceive and make judgments about the world. The MBTI theory incorporates four pairs of cognitive functions:

1. **Extraverted Thinking (Te) and Introverted Thinking (Ti):** Te focuses on organizing and structuring information externally, while Ti focuses on internal analysis and logical consistency.

2. **Extraverted Feeling (Fe) and Introverted Feeling (Fi):** Fe is concerned with the emotional needs of others and maintaining harmony, while Fi is focused on personal values and authenticity.

3. **Extraverted Sensing (Se) and Introverted Sensing (Si):** Se is attuned to immediate sensory experiences and the environment, while Si is focused on past experiences and personal impressions.

4. **Extraverted Intuition (Ne) and Introverted Intuition (Ni):** Ne explores new possibilities and connections, while Ni focuses on internal insights and future implications.

These cognitive functions operate in a specific order of dominance, with each individual typically favoring certain functions over others. This hierarchy of functions contributes to the unique personality profile of each MBTI type.
